# Credit-Risk-Analysis-
This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle, enhanced with additional variables focused on financial risk for loan approvals.
To expand the instances, SMOTENC (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous) was used, creating a dataset suitable for classification and regression modeling with both categorical and continuous features.
