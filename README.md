# Credit-Risk-Analysis-
This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle, enhanced with additional variables focused on financial risk for loan approvals.
To expand the instances, SMOTENC (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous) was used, creating a dataset suitable for classification and regression modeling with both categorical and continuous features.

Key Points:
Records: 45,000
Variables: 14
Types of Features: Categorical and Continuous

Potential Use Cases
This dataset supports various analyses and modeling approaches for credit risk and loan approval:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze distributions, correlations, and patterns in credit risk factors.
Identify key trends among demographic and loan variables.
Classification Modeling:

Build predictive models for loan approval (loan_status as target).
Train classifiers to identify approved vs. rejected loan applications.
Regression Analysis:

Predict credit_score based on individual and loan-related features.
Important Considerations
Data Quality: The synthetic data may include implausible values, such as applicants over 100 years old, reflecting limitations in the original data source.
Usage Scope: This dataset serves as a foundation for educational purposes, training, and testing machine learning models in financial risk prediction.
